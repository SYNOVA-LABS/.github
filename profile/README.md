## Overview
SYNOVA LABS is an innovative project focused on developing advanced AI agents for real-world applications. Our mission is to create intelligent systems that can understand and interact with the world in meaningful ways, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with artificial intelligence.

## Projects

### <a href="https://github.com/Proximum-AI/ADA">ADA</a>

ADA (Advanced Digital Agent) is my latest project, designed to be a JARVIS-like AI assistant that can answer questions like Siri but with enhanced contextual awareness of the world around you. As an admin, you have complete control over every action and capability of this agent.

#### Current Status
ADA is currently under active development with several features already implemented and many more on the roadmap. This represents the first of many models that will form the SYNOVA LABS ecosystem.

#### Key Features
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understands and responds to the environment
- **User Recognition**: Personalizes interactions based on the current user
- **Admin Controls**: Complete oversight of all agent operations and capabilities
- **Natural Language Processing**: Advanced conversation abilities
- more to come

## Overview
Proximum AI is an innovative project focused on developing advanced AI agents for real-world applications. The goal is to create intelligent systems that can understand and interact with the world in meaningful ways, combining futuristic ideas with AI to make them a reality.

## Projects

### <a href="https://github.com/Proximum-AI/ADA">ADA</a>

ADA (Advanced Digital Agent) is my latest project, designed to be a JARVIS-like AI assistant that can answer questions like Siri but with enhanced contextual awareness of the world around you. As an admin, you have complete control over every action and capability of this agent.

#### Current Status
##### V1.0 OUT!!!
v1.0 is ADA's first version. ADA is a modular personal assistant that combines facial recognition, wake word detection, and GPT-4o-powered visual analysis to create personalized user experiences. The system activates via phrases like "Hey ADA" and can answer questions about what it sees through the camera. Built with Python 3.10+, ADA features user recognition for customized interactions, natural speech processing, and real-time visual feedback. The architecture includes six main modules (User Detection, Activator, TTS, User Input, Vision GPT, and Models) working together to provide a seamless experience. Setup requires an OpenAI API key and basic hardware with a webcam and microphone.
